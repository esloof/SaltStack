# SaltStack Mind Map
I've created a mind map for vRealize Automation SaltStack Config and posted a copy on GitHub. The mind map is created in SimpleMind.  You can copy the smmx file to you own path, for example: 

/Users/esloof/Library/Containers/com.modelmakertools.simplemindmacstd/Data/Library/com.modelmakertools.simplemindmacstd/Mind Maps

You must replace esloof with your own username. The mind map will appear in the left pane after choosing View / Show Mind Maps.
